    <h3 class="special-banner-sub-1 rounded">Updates</h3>
    <p>At this point, you can pretty much check out the Github and you'd be essentially set on what's there to see. I think all the hiccups have been addressed. So then at this point, you may be wondering what's new... Aside from everything.</p>
    <p>Layout's been improved drastically. Things are looking less and less placeholder and temporary. That's pretty exciting! We also have some floating girls at the top banner. That's pretty cute.</p>
    <p>I just added more storyboarder-specific things, such as being able to see all the storyboards a storyboarder has created. The Community section has some cute Credits now as a base.</p>
    <h3 class="special-banner-sub-1 rounded">Future Plans</h3>
    <p>You'd think I'd have a better place to put this, like some Kanban flowchart or some Trello board. But nope! Here's a roadmap:</p>
    <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Homepage</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">Have a "featured" storyboard section up top. Actually populate the page with content.</dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Showcase</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">Finish layouting the showcase cards. <del>Apply that layout to the detail pages.</del></dd>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3"><del>Then be able to show storyboards/mediums a storyboarder has used.</del></dd>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">Improve searching and filter order. Implement infinite pagination.</dd>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">Easier import of maps in Twintails? Also, look into other fields.</dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Learn</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">Populate the page with content, split between learning and resources.</dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Community</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">Find good ways to advertise and display the Discord server and community.</dd>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">Perhaps we can rename this to someone else too?</dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Overall</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">Make the banner more responsive? Have ways to help show amazing storyboards more.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3 class="special-banner-sub-1 rounded">What Do?</h3>
