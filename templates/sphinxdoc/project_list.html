            Welcome! The learn page is currently undergoing some massive renovation right now. The eventual endgame is to make a comprehensive guide that is accessible to anyone interested in learning how to storyboard. The learning curve is often high for many newcomers, so it's in our hopes that these guides make that experience far more user-friendly. Feel free to view the work-in-progress guides by following the link below!
