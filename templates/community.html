        <p>I heard they're looking for people at this place called 4chan. I know the 4-H club is pretty excellent, so I think this place sounds pretty good too. Why don't you check it out sometime?</p>
    <h1 class="special-banner-4 rounded">Serious Information</h1>
        <p>Just kidding. We never have serious information here.</p>
    <h1 class="special-banner-4 rounded">Special Credits</h1>
        <p>Our community is brought to you by amazing osu! players, mappers, and, most importantly among our site, storyboarders. Without these guys, we wouldn't have such wondrous visual works on osu!.</p>
